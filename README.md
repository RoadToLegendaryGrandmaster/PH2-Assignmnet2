# Explain the difference between any, unknown, and never types in TypeScript
TypeScript is a strongly typed compiler language, but we can use daynamic typing like javaScript but not recommended. I will explain three types of TypeScript that we all should know.

any: In this type we can avoid type checking for the input.
unknow: It is alternative to any type in TS, we can use for more safer option.
never: we are use this type is error checking whcih will never return something.
